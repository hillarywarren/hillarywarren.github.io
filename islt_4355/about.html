     <p>My name is Hillary Warren, and I am currently a special education teacher in the St. Louis public school district. 
     I have been a special education teacher for the past three years since I received my degree from UMSL. I love my fourth and fifth grade students 
     I teach, as they bring a smile to my face every day. 
     My goal as their teacher is to create a warm and welcoming environment to all that walk into my classroom. As a special education teacher, 
     it is imperative to know each student inside and out to best meet their needs as students.</p> 
     <br/>
     <p>Some would say I am married to my work, but my husbandâ€™s name is Tyler. We have been married for three years and we have a cat (Vinny) and a dog (Diesel). 
     Together they create Vin Diesel, as a prominent duo in our household. We enjoy playing video games together since we started dating back in 2011.</p>
