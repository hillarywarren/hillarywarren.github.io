     My name is Hillary Warren, and I am currently a special education teacher in the St. Louis public school district. I have been a special education teacher for the past three years since I received my degree from UMSL. I love my fourth and fifth grade students I teach, as they bring a smile to my face every day. My goal as their teacher is to create a warm and welcoming environment to all that walk into my classroom. As a special education teacher, it is imperative to know each student inside and out to best meet their needs as students. Some would say I am married to my work, but my husbandâ€™s name is Tyler. We have been married for three years and we have a cat (Vinny) and a dog (Diesel). Together they create Vin Diesel, as a prominent duo in our household. We enjoy playing video games together since we started dating back in 2011.

My previous web application and web design was back in high school in 2012-2013. These were by far my favorite extracurricular classes, as I loved working around a computer and photoshop. My expectations for this course are to become more knowledgeable around the world of web designing as I have my own small business and it could be beneficial for me in the long run if I grow my business.
